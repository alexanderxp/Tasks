    You know that there are a certain number there (n), 
    but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number,

    As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), 
    populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.
    For example, if n = 10:

    /* 3. The Story:
    Bob is working as a bus driver. 
    However, he has become extremely popular amongst the city's residents. 
    With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, 
    he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on the bus! 
    He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.
    Task Overview:
    You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:
    cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
    on is the number of people on the bus.
    wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus.
    If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, 
    return the number of passengers he can't take.
    Usage Examples:
    >>> enough(10, 5, 5)
    0 # He can fit all 5 passengers
    >>> enough(100, 60, 50)
    10 # He can't fit 10 out of 50 waiting
    */
    function enaugh(cap, on, wait) {
      return cap - on - wait >= 0 ? 0 : cap - on;

    /* 4. Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), 
    that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.
    Example:
    createPhoneNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) // => returns "(123) 456-7890"
    The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge. 
    Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!
    */
    function createPhoneNumber(phoneArr) { 
      return phoneArr.reduce(function (phone, item, i) { 
          return i == 3 ? phone + ') ' + item : i == 6 ? phone + '-' + item : phone + item;
        },'(' ); 	
    }
	
	//createPhoneNumber([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]) ;        
	// returns "(123) 456-7890"
	
    /* 5. The function takes in 2 inputs x and y,
    and should return x to the power of y
    Simple, right? But you're NOT allowed to use Math.pow();
    Obs: x and y will be naturals, so DON'T take fractions into consideration;
    Note : zero to the power of zero equals one in this kata
    Great coding <3
    */

      return y != 1 ? x * pow(x, y - 1) : x;

    /* 6. Task Overview
    Americans are odd people: in their buildings, 
    the first floor is actually the ground floor and there is no 13th floor 
    ('cause of superstition).
    Write a function that given an American floor (passed as an integer) returns the real floor.
    Moreover, your function should work for basement floors too: 
    just return the same value as the passed one.
    Usage Examples
    get_real_floor(1) == 0 
    get_real_floor(0) == 0 # Special case to please Europeans
    get_real_floor(5) == 4
    get_real_floor(15) == 13
    get_real_floor(-3) == -3
    */
    function getRealFloor(n) {
      return n < 14 ? n > 1 ? n - 1 : 0 : n > 1 ? n - 2 : 0;
